# Gomoku with AI Mode and Chat Client

This game is a client-server program that exchanges gameplay data, gameboard updates, and chat messages via a TCP/IP network. Users can play in either human or AI mode. In human mode, the user gets paired with another user who joins the server. In AI mode, the user's AI gets paired with another user's AI who joins the server. The AI next-best-move algorithm was written from scratch using a zero-sum game (minimax) model.
